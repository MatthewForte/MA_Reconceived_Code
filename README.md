# MA_Reconceived_Code
Supplementary Code for Paper "Meta-Analysis Reconceived From a Finite Population Sampling Perspective"

# Description
There are a few items to note in this repository. First is the R markdown file "code_for_case_studies.Rmd", which includes all the code needed to produce the analyses and tables found within the paper.

Second, is the "Data" folder, which contains the data for both Example 1 and Example 2 in the paper. The data for Example 1 come from downloading the "Data from Studies Reviews" from the What Works Clearinghouse website, and within this repository you will find the full export from the WWC as well as a cleaned version which only includes those studies used in the analysis within this paper. The cleaned version of the data also includes population values (N) which were obtained from The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2022). The data for Example 2 come from a systematic review on Multisystemic Therapy (Littell et al., 2021) and were manually extracted from the paper, and similarly population values were appended, obtained from UNICEF's "How Many" data tool (UNICEF, 2023).
